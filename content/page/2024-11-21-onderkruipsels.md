For the second assignment in Inge's workshop, we need to create and design a catalog for the exhibition *‘Onderkruipsels, Little Creatures in Art and Science’* by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. We are free to decide the format, the number of pages, and the proportions of the catalog, but the total number of pages must always be a multiple of 4. The choice of fonts is entirely up to us as well. What’s important is that we take into account the context of the exhibition, where the catalog will be browsed and taken home. We will design the cover, the interior, and the back cover. The text itself will be provided to us.
