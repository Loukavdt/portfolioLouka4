This scale model was created for the Design course as part of the Interior Design program.\
Building 019, a former industrial site in Dok Noord, Ghent, was reconstructed to scale using wood and laser-cutting techniques. The interior design focuses on the organic shapes inspired by the work of artist Richard Serra. The result is a model that reflects both the industrial characteristics and the fluid, sculptural interior space.
