For the second assignment in Johan's workshop, we need to collect data about ourselves for a week and visualize it in two ways: one visualization focusing on the aspect of time and another focusing on the aspect of location. First, we create a manual visualization by developing various sketches based on the collected data. Then, we digitize these using Adobe Illustrator and present them as a poster in InDesign.
