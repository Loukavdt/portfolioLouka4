This scale model was created for the Design course, featuring the Regatta Tower at the Watersportbaan in Ghent. The model was entirely hand-cut using materials such as wood, concrete, plexiglass, and metal. The tower was designed to include sleeping accommodations for fishermen staying overnight, with an open kitchen on the ground floor. This kitchen serves as a meeting place where fishermen can prepare and share meals together. The location and design provide an ideal base for fishermen at the Watersportbaan.
